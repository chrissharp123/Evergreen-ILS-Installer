***NOTE: This program is currently unstable and I do not recommend using it at the moment ;-) ***

This program is based on the "eg_dev_lenny_installer" script written by 
Bill Erickson of ESI, and is intended to provide an as fully automated as
possible installation of recent versions of Evergreen and OpenSRF.

The pinesify.sh script will access the files in PINES-files and PINES-Patches
to make the Evergreen server have the look and feel (and some functionality -
more to come!) of the PINES production instance of Evergreen.  It should be 
on an Evergreen 1.6.1.X installation.

WARNING: This is for development and evaluation purposes only.  This 
script makes a lot of assumptions and does stuff you won't like.  
Use at own risk.

Steps:
1. Install Debian Lenny
2. Put these files on the server
3. Run this script as root and do what it says
