This program is based on the "eg_dev_lenny_installer" script written by 
Bill Erickson of ESI, and is intended to provide an as fully automated as
possible installation of recent versions of Evergreen and OpenSRF.

WARNING: This is for development and evaluation purposes only.  This 
script makes a lot of assumptions and does stuff you won't like.  
Use at own risk.

Steps:
1. Install Debian Lenny
2. Put these files on the server
3. Run this script as root and do what it says
